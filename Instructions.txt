Implement an FSM with minimum of six states including start and end. You will need to use the
advanced behaviors from SPADE framework.

Create a game, use your imagination. Earlier years we’ve had games about a woodchopper, cutting
down wood before it already was downed by birds. A knight fighting different bosses. A runner trying
to catch the bus and so on. Some student added pictures based on either victory or defeat, some added
randomized values, so the games never ended the same way, making it interesting every time.

The FSM Machine can easily “only be a counter”, state X goes to Z and increases every time, when X
reaches a limit, it goes to state Y. Done. Well, this lab is about understanding the behaviors and
applying your own touch and knowledge so make it a game not just a counter.

The game could work independently or ask/prompt the user for inputs, it’s up to you.

Comment the code on a level as you would explain it to a fellow student, I don’t want to read “this is
a string, string is when letters are used” or summarization such as: This is the state A. This is state B
end. Make it the way you would have wanted it to be if you were to take over it from another group.
Make sure all group members names are included as comments in the beginning of the code. It needs
to work, if not it will not be going to pass.
